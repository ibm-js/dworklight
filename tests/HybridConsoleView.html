    <div data-dojo-type="dojox.mobile.RoundRect" data-dojo-props="">
        <p>
            This tests out the &quot;issw/mobile/worklight/hybrid-console&quot; module's
            ability to intercept console.xxx() and WL.Logger.xxx() calls.
        </p>
        <p>
            The XCode (IOS) and LogCat (Android) logging environments only support a 
            single string console logging argument. Passing extra arguments are ignored,
            and passing in an object produces "null". Not very helpful.
        </p>
        <p>
            In hybrid applications, console interceptors are put in place by the worklight or
            cordova modules. These will accept all normal console arguments and attempt to
            merge and format objects as JSON strings. If running under Worklight, the Wl.Logger
            functions are also intercepted.
        </p>
        <p>
            All output of these tests are shown in the appropriate logging environment. Look for
            Errors being thrown or any output that does not look proper.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following console commands are run on each view of this test, being called with a;
            string, integer, boolean, null, object, and various combinations:<br/><pre>
    console.debug();
    console.log();
    console.info();
    console.warn();
    console.error();</pre>
            If a worklight-based hybrid application, these are also tested<br/><pre>
    WL.Logger.debug();
    WL.Logger.error();
            </pre>
        </p>  
    </div>
